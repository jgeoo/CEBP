# Stock Exchange

## Description
**Stock Exchange** is a distributed system that simulates a stock market where shares of various companies are traded. This system allows buyers and sellers to execute transactions through offers and requests, ensuring access to information about them as well as the transaction history.

## Features

- **Selling Shares**: Sellers can offer a number of shares at a specified price.
- **Buying Shares**: Buyers can express their intent to purchase a number of shares at a desired price.
- **Automatic Trading**: Transactions are executed automatically when an offer matches a request in price, trading a minimum number of shares (the minimum of the offer and request).
- **Access to Information**: All users have access to information related to offers, requests, and transaction history.
- **Modify Requests and Offers**: Requests and offers can be modified at any time as long as there is no ongoing transaction.
